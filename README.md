# Unrest

Lean and mean web framework for Python / Postgres

## Hello. 

Do not use.

This library is experimental. Wildly breaking changes are guaranteed. The repo is only public so it can be accessed by `pip`.

That said, if you really have nothing better to do, you can check out the [quickstart](https://github.com/workingproof/unrest/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md) to get a sense of where it is headed.
